\subsection{Treo Compiler} \label{sec:treo}
The Treo \cite{treo} compiler \cite{reo:git} converts a textual reo protocol into a target language.

\subsection{Reo\_rs Compiler}
The Reo-rs compiler \cite{reors:git} outputs a shared object that can be interfaced with from C programs, through an ABI.

\subsection{Hardware}
We benchmarked our code on a machine with two Intel Xeon E5645 Hexacore CPUs, each with plenty of RAM. We disabled hyperthreading, and turbo boost to make the comparisons as fair as possible.
