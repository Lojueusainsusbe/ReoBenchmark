\section{Implementation}

We designed our C\texttt{++} framework such that interactions between objects closely resemble interactions between Reo components. To this end, we made classes for producers, consumers and protocols. The producers and consumers interact with the protocols through \verb|get()| and \verb|put()| functions, that mimic the get and put behaviour seen in Reo.\\\\
%
To actually implement the protocol's logic, we used the POSIX threads library\cite{pthreads}. This low level threading library would most likely be used in any application where speed is of importance. The exact protocol implementations can be found in the \verb|c/src| folder \cite{us:git}.
