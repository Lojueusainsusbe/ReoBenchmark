\section{Implementation}

We designed our own Implementations of these protocols as classes in C\texttt{++}.
The classes have a put() and get() function that behave just like a put and get to a port in a Reo protocol.
We made sure that a thread blocks and conintues in the put() and get() functions just like a Reo protocol would block when getting and putting.
To actually implement the protocol's logic, we used the POSIX threads library.
This is a low level threading library that would most likely be used in any application where speed is of importance.
