\section{Introduction}
Many programs are comprised of different parallel processes that need to synchronize, communicate, or pass messages. Such behaviour can be expressed as a protocol defining the data flow between different processes. Current implementations of such behaviour use near archaic programming paradigms such as mutexes, semaphores, monitors, etc. Such implementations are often low level, leaving the compiler little room for optimisation. \\
The Reo Coordination Language \cite{reo} allows for the high level specification of a communication protocol. This enables the compiler to optimise the code to a greater extent. \\\\
%
Using version 1.0.1 of the Reo Compiler \cite{reo:git} and the Reo\_rs library \cite{reors:git} we will benchmark several treo circuits by comparing them to C\texttt{++} implementations.\\
We will provide a specification of the implemented protocols and describe their behaviour. We give a description of our experiments, and present and discuss the results.
