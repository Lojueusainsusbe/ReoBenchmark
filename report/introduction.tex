\section{Introduction}
Many programs are comprised of different parallel processes that need to synchronize, communicate, or pass messages. Such behavior can be expressed as a protocol defining the data flow between different processes. Current implementations of such behavior use near archaic programming paradigms such as mutexes, semaphores, monitors, etc. Such implementations are generally implemented on a low level, making modification or verifying the higher level protocol disproportionately difficult.\\
